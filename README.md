# Learn_React_MUI


Material UI is a UI component library. It provides us with components to build awesome user interfaces in quick time. It is also an implementation of google's material design specification. Just like how we have Angular Material for angular and Vuetify for Vue, we have Material UI for React. The goal here is to learn how to use the library components to build clean and elegant UI.
